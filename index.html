        Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an
        important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its
        thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails
        behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded forest of the
        sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine
        grounds.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines
        dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice.
