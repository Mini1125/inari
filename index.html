      Fushimi Inari Shrine (伏見稲荷大社, Fushimi Inari Taisha) is an
      important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its
      thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails
      behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded forest of the
      sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine
      grounds.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines
      dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice.
